# psiFHE_Tool: A Privacy-Preserving Multi-Party Set Intersection Tool

The **psiFHE_Tool** is a revolutionary application designed to perform **private set intersection (PSI)** calculations across multiple databases, leveraging **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology**. This tool empowers organizations such as hospitals and banks to securely compute the common elements in their datasets without exposing sensitive information, thereby ensuring maximum privacy and confidentiality.

## The Problem We Address

In today’s data-driven world, organizations often need to collaborate and share insights while keeping their data private and secure. However, the challenge lies in allowing multiple untrusted data holders to intersect their databases to find shared information - such as identifying individuals suffering from a specific condition who have also applied for a loan - without revealing any private data to each other. This challenge raises significant concerns about data privacy and security, making traditional methods of data sharing inadequate for maintaining confidentiality.

## The FHE Solution

Our solution to this problem is based on the implementation of **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** using Zama’s open-source libraries. By leveraging FHE, the psiFHE_Tool allows data to remain encrypted while computations are performed. This means that even when multiple parties cooperate for data analysis, their individual datasets are never revealed, ensuring a secure environment for collaborative operations. Using Zama's libraries, such as **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs**, we've built a robust tool that empowers data alliances with the very highest level of privacy protection.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Party Privacy Intersection Calculation**: Compute shared elements across multiple untrusted databases without revealing anything about their contents.
- **Selective Disclosure of Results**: Users can choose to disclose results to authorized parties only, enhancing data governance and privacy.
- **High-Level Privacy Protection**: Built on FHE, ensuring that sensitive information remains secure throughout the process.
- **User-Friendly Command-Line Interface**: Access and execute functionalities seamlessly, designed for both developers and data scientists.
- **Compatible with Various Database Systems**: No restrictions on database types, making it versatile for different organizational needs.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption SDK**: Core component for confidential computation.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building scalable applications.
- **Hardhat**: A development environment for compiling, deploying, and testing smart contracts.
- **Foundry**: A smart contract development tool.
- **Additional Tools**: Libraries and tools necessary for building and executing the application.

## Directory Structure

Here's how the project's directory is structured:

```
psiFHE_Tool/
├── contracts/
│   └── psiFHE_Tool.sol
├── src/
│   ├── main.js
│   └── utils.js
├── test/
│   └── psiFHE_Tool.test.js
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

## Installation Guide

To set up the psiFHE_Tool, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have **Node.js** installed. You can check your version by running `node -v`.
2. Install **Hardhat** or **Foundry** depending on your preference for contract development. Use the command `npm install -g hardhat` for Hardhat.
3. Navigate to your project directory. 
4. Run `npm install` to fetch the required Zama FHE libraries along with other dependencies.

Please refrain from using `git clone` or any URLs; installation should be done locally.

## Build & Run Guide

To compile, test, and run the psiFHE_Tool, execute the following commands:

```bash
# Compile the smart contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run the tests to ensure everything is working correctly
npx hardhat test

# Execute the main application
node src/main.js
```

Here’s an example of how you might call the main interface of the tool in the `main.js` file:

```javascript
const { initializeFHE, performPrivateIntersection } = require('./utils');

async function main() {
    const fheContext = await initializeFHE();
    
    // Example datasets
    const dataset1 = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'];
    const dataset2 = ['Charlie', 'David', 'Eve'];

    const commonElements = await performPrivateIntersection(fheContext, dataset1, dataset2);
    console.log("Common Elements:", commonElements);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

This code snippet illustrates how to initialize the FHE context and perform a private intersection of two datasets, showcasing the tool’s functionality in a simple and understandable manner.
